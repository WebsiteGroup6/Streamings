    <h1 class="Screen1"> Our Stream Journey</h1>
    <p class="p1">It all started when we met up at SM for a fun content-creation day. We had planned to go live while talking about our topic—time management. The first stop was finding the perfect coffee shop where we could settle down and create the right atmosphere. After a bit of searching, we found a cozy spot and got ready to hit “go live.” <br>
        <br>

        With our coffee in hand and the energy buzzing, we kicked off with a “Get Ready With Us” live session on TikTok. We talked through our makeup routines, sipping our drinks, and shared some insights on how we balance everything going on in our lives. The interaction was incredible—comments flooded in, some hyping us up and others offering critiques. While the positive vibes were strong, the negative feedback threw us off for a moment. <br>
        <br>
        Feeling the need for a change, we decided to wrap things up on TikTok and move the session over to Instagram, where we knew our community would be more positive and supportive. The switch made a big difference, and the conversations flowed effortlessly as we wrapped up our makeup and time management chat.
        <br>
        <br>
        After about an hour of great engagement, laughter, and some heartfelt moments, we ended the live, feeling both accomplished and refreshed. It was time to head home, knowing we had connected with so many and shared something meaningful.
