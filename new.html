            <div class="Screen">TWITCH</div>
            <p class="p">The top streaming site in the world, Twitch is home to various streamers who are contracted with the site, such as xQc, Ninja, and other online streamers. Although Twitch has endured many controversies about their management, the poor contract negotiations with their creators, etc. they are still top of the charts when it comes to streaming. To this day, Twitch has been the highest quality streaming service one could have, despite its noticeable push towards more corporate and greedy changes.

            <div class="Screen">YOUTUBE</div>
            <p><div class="p">YouTube is not necessarily known for its streaming services, as it mostly caters to online videos. But due to the recent migration of streamers from Twitch moving to YouTube after frustrating and outrageous contract disagreements with them. YouTube is now home to most of the new streamers that have reached the top of the list, such as, iShowSpeed and CaseOh, while also keeping up the older big name creators that decided to move from Twitch to YouTube after years of streaming there, such as Ludwig, CourageJD and Valkyrae. Overall, YouTube is the base standard for a streaming service.</p></div>

            <div class="Screen">KICK</div>
            <p><div class="p"> Lesser known by the wider global community, Kick has also taken Twitch’s streamers, the previously mentioned xQc did move over to Kick after being offered a better deal than Twitch, which sparked other streamers to move to Kick, such as Adin Ross and TrainwreckTV. Kick is much more low quality than Twitch, due to the site and company being fresh and new to the streaming industry, but their main selling point is the care the developers put into Kick, allowing viewers and streamers alike to feel like they weren’t just there to generate more money from Twitch and having major inconveniences with the website.

            <div class="Screen">SPOTIFY</div>
            <p><div class="p"> Spotify has been a staple in the music industry, it is the main application music artists use to publish their works for the public, and is the first app that was created to stream free music and podcasts without having to pay for every song or episode. Of course, Spotify’s main use is for everyday life, it allows you to play music and podcasts you can listen to in your sleep, as background noise, and helps you relax and focus while working. Spotify has changed over the years, and has ended up just like Twitch, the corporation running Spotify has made it quite difficult to even listen to music or podcasts without receiving an unskippable ad which disturbs the flow you are trying to create by having constant music or podcasts to listen to. This has pushed many users to switch to lesser known streaming platforms that offer better deals, no ads, and free music. Spotify nowadays is mostly used for Podcasts that are exclusive to Spotify, or some people just buy Spotify Premium with an added family plan so that up to 6 people can enjoy the app.
